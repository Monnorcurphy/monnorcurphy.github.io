									<p>Hello, my name is Connor Murphy and I am a web developer. I have experience with Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, and more.
										I would have to say that my biggest asset is my ability to reach things on high shelves. My favorite thing to do is make people smile,
										second would probably be annoying those same people until they are a little mad at me. I enjoy working on complicated problems that
										keep me up until 3 in the morning, and learning about anything, especially if it will help me solve problems or build new things.
										If you have questions about my background or would like to talk about a project you would like to work on, please don't hesitate to reach out.
										I look forward to speaking with you.</p>

									<h2>Books</h2>

									<h3>Learning Web Design<h3>
									<h4>Jennifer Niedesrst Robbins<h4>
									<p>A good introduction to HTML and CSS, a very rough introduction to Javascript. Perfect for beginners, who enjoy
									learning from textbook style books. Very detailed.<p>

									<h3>HTML and CSS<h3>
									<h4>Jon Duckett<h4>
									<p>A fantastic introduction to HTML and CSS, with very colorful text, and basic descriptions of all the basics. Perfect for all
										beginners. The books presentation is easy to follow, easy to read, and helps teach about design, while also teaching you
										how to work with HTML and CSS. The drawback is, it is not as detailed as Learning Web Design, and you won't feel like reading
										Ms. Robbins book after you read this one.<p>

									<h3>Grokking Algorithims<h3>
									<h4>Aditya Y. Bhargava<h4>
									<p>A very basic look at algorithims, with a fantastic intro to Big O notation, and some basic algorithims. What makes this book
										truly perfect for beginners is the number of things the author tells you to research. Once you finish the book, you know exactly
										what you will be reading and looking into next to improve your skills.<p>

									<h3>Cracking the Coding Interview<h3>
									<h4>Gayle Laakmann McDowell<h4>
									<p>Currently in Progress<p>
