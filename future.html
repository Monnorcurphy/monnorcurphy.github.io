										<h4>Art of Langauge Institute</h4>
										<p>I built this website for a Spanish tutor who is interested in starting his own business.
											The website was paused because of financing and determing what the business needs were going to be.
										  Moving forward their needs to be css styling updates to be more consistent. I took some risks and
										tried to be bold and do something different. It was fun, but the style doesn't look good and needs to
										work for a functional business. I am going to update with a paygate, a more consistent CSS styling,
										some map features, as well as the ability to book teachers online. The frameworks need to be updated
										with a more modern tech stack, and things which will echo what the business needs are.</p>
										<h4>FakeFlix</h4>
										<p>This is an old version of rails, as well as some old React patterns. The site is slow in certain
										areas (actor movie list), and needs some general css refactors. This is also an opportunity for a more
										modern tech stack.</p>
										<h4>PseudoCoder</h4>
										<p>The knowledge here is good, but the style (both the writing and the CSS) is a bit garish. I want
										to update this to be a more toned down, and consistent, css style along with a tone that is more
									  approchable.</p>

												<h3>What I am doing today</h3>
												<p>As of June 19th, I am looking for work. I started with reupping my fullstack project from my
													coding bootcamp, which meant repopulating the databse, and solving various development erorrs.
													Right now I am updating my personal site with the changes that my various personal projects
													need, as well as deciding what projects I will be working on. Check back for updates on what
													I am reading and what I am working on.
                      </p>

												<p>I have been on vacation for a few weeks, and found some articles I wanted to catch up on, as well
													as some articles I never had the time to get to. If you want to see the list, and how I am progressing

												<h3>Algorithms</h3>
												<p>I am going to redo Gayle Mcdowell's Cracking the Coding Interview, which you can purchase <a href="goo.gl/yYiQZ9">here</a>.
													I think it is without a doubt one of the best programming textbooks out there, and if you haven't bought it, this is likely your
													firs time hearing about it. I am also going to be doing <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university">this
														repo</a>, and will have a repo with my answers to come.
